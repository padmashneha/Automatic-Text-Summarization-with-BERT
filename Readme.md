# Automatic Text Summarization with BERT

In today's fast-paced world, where time is a precious commodity, staying informed can be a challenge. People often find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information available, making it difficult to keep up with the latest news and articles. To address this issue, automatic text summarization has emerged as a valuable tool, providing users with quick and concise summaries of lengthy texts.

## Overview

This GitHub repository houses a project that leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for automatic text summarization. BERT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding context and semantics, making it an ideal candidate for summarization tasks.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to offer a solution to the time constraints faced by individuals who wish to stay informed. By employing BERT for text summarization, we aim to provide users with the gist of news articles or lengthy pieces of text, allowing them to grasp the essential information quickly.

## Methodology

### 1. Utilizing BERT for Text Summarization

We delve into the specifics of using BERT for text summarization and compare its performance with previous NLP technologies. The paper associated with this project offers a comprehensive review of the advancements in NLP and highlights the unique strengths of BERT in the context of summarization.

### 2. Benchmark Datasets

We utilize two benchmark datasets for training and evaluation purposes:

- **CNN/DailyMail:** A corpus containing a diverse collection of news articles.
- **HCQ Dataset:** A stance detection dataset focused on news articles related to COVID-19, specifically centered around Hydroxychloroquine.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics

The effectiveness of the text summarization model is assessed using the ROUGE score. This metric helps measure the quality of the summary by comparing it against reference summaries, providing a quantitative evaluation of the model's performance.

## Repository Structure

- **`code/`:** Contains the implementation code for the text summarization model.
- **`datasets/`:** Houses the benchmark datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`results/`:** Stores the output summaries generated by the model.
- **`paper/`:** Includes the detailed paper discussing the methodology, results, and insights gained from the project.

## Getting Started

To explore and use the text summarization model:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the README file within the `code/` directory.

## Results

The `results/` directory contains the generated summaries for the benchmark datasets. Users can compare these summaries with the original texts to assess the model's summarization accuracy.

## Contributing
